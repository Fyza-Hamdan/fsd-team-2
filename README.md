## About this Project

### General Description

A very warm welcome to preview our E-Commerce Website.

This is the group Capstone project for the Generation SG Fullstack Developer programme Final Course Module, comprising of four team members in each group to develop either an E-Commerce or Social Network Web Application.

### Objectives

To implement a fully working web application with the following layers:

* Persistence: MySQL Database.
* Backend: REST API with Java and Spring Boot.
* Frontend: JavaScript + CSS + HTML.


### Team Project Information

Our four member team has decided to develop an E-Commerce website or web application dealing with Pets products and providing its related services. We have decided to call our new founded company, PetPurely.
